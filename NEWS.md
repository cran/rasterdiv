# rasterdiv 0.2.0
## Major changes
* New parametrization of Rao's quadratic entropy. This parametrization reconciles abundance-based indexes with distance-based indexes (Rao). The new function is called paRARO(), which stand for parametric Rao's entropy.

## Minor changes
* Minor improvements in the structure of all main functions.
* Option to save the output as a rasterstack for all main functions.
* pbapply and pbmcapply for progress bars.
* Vignette simplified.

# rasterdiv 0.1.0

* Shannonâ€“Wiener index of diversity
* Renyi entropy
* Simpson index
* Berger-Parker index
* Hill numbers of order q or effective number of species
* Pielou evenness
* Rao's quadratic entropy
* Cumulative Residual entropy
