# rasterdiv 0.2.1
## Major changes
* A new function **accRao** to derive the accumulation function of parametric Rao's index over a range of alphas. A vignette (rasterdiv_advanced_accRao) to show how to apply this function was added to the package.

# rasterdiv 0.2.0
## Major changes
* New parametrization of Rao's quadratic entropy. This parametrization reconciles abundance-based indexes with distance-based indexes (Rao). The new function is called **paRao**, which stands for parametric Rao's entropy.

## Minor changes
* Minor improvements in the structure of all main functions.
* Option to save the output as a rasterstack for all main functions.
* pbapply and pbmcapply for progress bars.
* Main vignette (rasterdiv_basics) simplified.

# rasterdiv 0.1.0

* Shannonâ€“Wiener index of diversity
* Renyi entropy
* Simpson index
* Berger-Parker index
